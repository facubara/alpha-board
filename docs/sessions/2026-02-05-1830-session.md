**Goal**: Phase 8 — Rankings UI Polish. Add search, sort, ISR config, and responsive layout.
**Agent Roles**: Bash

## Model Settings

| Setting | Value | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Subagent Model | `inherit` | Model for subagent tasks: `inherit`, `haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus` |

*`inherit` = use conversation model. Use `haiku` for cost savings on bounded tasks.*

## Work Summary

Polished the Rankings UI with client-side search/filter, sortable columns (rank, symbol, score, confidence), sentiment badges in indicator breakdown, ISR revalidation (60s), and responsive layout improvements for mobile/tablet. All interactions verified working via successful build.

| ISR interval | 60 seconds | Balance freshness vs performance |
| Mobile score display | Inline below symbol | Space-efficient on small screens |
