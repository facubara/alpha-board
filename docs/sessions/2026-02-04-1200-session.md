# Session: 2026-02-04 12:00

**Goal**: Create comprehensive implementation plan (all phases, start to finish)
**Agent Roles**: Plan, Explore

## Model Settings

| Setting | Value | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Subagent Model | `inherit` | Model for subagent tasks: `inherit`, `haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus` |

*`inherit` = use conversation model. Use `haiku` for cost savings on bounded tasks.*

## Work Summary

Created a comprehensive 14-phase implementation plan for Alpha Board, covering the full journey from project scaffolding to production deployment. Reviewed the existing PRD (v2.0) and Technical Spec (v1.0) to ensure the plan aligns with all requirements. The plan organizes work into 5 stages (Foundation, Rankings Frontend, Agent Backend, Agent Frontend, Deployment) with clear dependencies, deliverables, and file lists per phase.

## Files Changed

### Created
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Full 14-phase implementation roadmap with dependency graph, deliverables, and complexity estimates
- `docs/sessions/2026-02-04-1200-session.md` - This session file

### Modified
- None

### Deleted
- None

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Plan structure | 14 phases across 5 stages | Matches natural dependency order: foundation → backend → frontend → deploy |
| Phase granularity | One session per phase | Each phase produces a testable deliverable without being too large |
| Execution order | Sequential with parallelization notes | Stages B and C can run in parallel, but sequential is safest for a single developer |

*Note: Create an ADR in `docs/adr/` for significant architectural decisions*

## Security Checklist

- [x] No hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- [x] All data is synthetic (no real customer/company data)
- [x] No proprietary algorithms exposed (using stubs)
- [x] Environment variables used for configuration

## Commit Message

```
docs(plan): add 14-phase implementation plan for Alpha Board

- Create comprehensive implementation roadmap (docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
- Cover all stages: foundation, rankings, agents, frontend, deployment
- Include dependency graph, deliverables, file lists, and complexity estimates
- Add first session file tracking this planning work

```

**Commit types**: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore

## Next Steps

- [ ] Phase 1: Project scaffolding — set up monorepo (worker/ + web/), dependencies, config
- [ ] Phase 2: Database schema — Alembic migrations for all 12 tables, seed 28 agents
- [ ] Phase 3: Binance client — OHLCV data fetching with rate limiting

## Notes

First session for the Alpha Board project. PRD and Technical Spec are thorough and well-structured, making the plan straightforward to derive. The two highest-complexity phases are Phase 9 (Agent Core) and Phase 12 (Agent Detail Page).
